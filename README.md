# AguilarFMiniChallenge2
Recreating Mini Challenge 2 where the user chooses two numbers. The program takes both inputs and adds them together. Adding data validation.

Peer Reviewed By: Marcel R. The program runs well. It has a replay function and data validation for ints. The instructions are clear so the right inputs are typed. Solid work!
